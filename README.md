Manuel Rodriguez de Guzman

This unit brings together previous experience of programming, numerical techniques and mathematical methods, with the aim of enabling me to put scientific programming into practice in a project/research setting. The approach is practical rather than theoretical and will cover the techniques and skills needed to do real scientific programming for a range of commonly occurring problem types.

The numerical techniques  covered will include an appropriate choice of numerical method for different classes of ODEs (e.g., stiff problems, and boundary value problems), together with the most widely-used methods to solve PDEs (e.g., finite difference, finite element, and spectral methods). It will be grounded throughout in the fundamentals of software engineering, enabling me to develop efficient programming techniques (e.g., version control, profiling and optimising code), as well as proper use of 3rd party libraries/applications, and hence successfully manage large-scale complex projects.

I managed to do the following:
 * Implement advanced numerical methods for the solution of real-world problems
 * Select, assess, modify and adapt numerical algorithms, guided by an awareness of their mathematical foundations
 * Apply appropriate computational techniques to solve ODE problems
 * Apply appropriate computational techniques to solve PDE problems
 * Create production-standard code, based on sound software engineering principles.
